- [ ] generalise Method to any solver
- [ ] create python functions for each solver
- [ ] generalise RandomParams for any kind of graph generation including from datasets

Kinds of tests
- Pre hamiltonian vary degree
- Only hamiltonian vary degree
- Relatively spars graphs high vertex counts
- Test only the accuracy?

Datasets
- Erdos Reyni
- DAGs (expanded) (planted paths)
- Planted paths
- Top 2000
- Maybe more real world datasets
- Maybe subgraphs of real world graphs

All of this in both directed and undirected case.
